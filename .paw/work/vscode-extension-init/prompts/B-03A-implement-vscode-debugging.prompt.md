This is not part of the original implementation plan - I want to be able to run the vs code extension through the VS Code debugger. This should be possible with a simple launch configuration change.

Update the implementation plan and spec to account for this new requirement. Then implement the change. I'm already on a one-off 'phase' branch for this change.
