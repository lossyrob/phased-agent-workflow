Use the GitHub Projects MCP server to get the top issue (first returned) in the 'Ready' status. Give me the issue URL and instruct me to run 'PAW: New Workflow' with that issue URL to get started. Also suggest a branch name based on the issue. Format the branch and issue URL in code blocks so I can easily copy the text.
