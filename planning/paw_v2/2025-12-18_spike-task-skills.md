So I started down the path of the sub task to try to spike out the redesign of Paul to be skills based and I think this plan misses the mark. So I want to clarify the approach and actually try a different spike task. This is this is going to be a big change, so I want to be careful about layering in the change, in making progressive changes to Paul. That will prove out the process, but also sort of build the foundation while it goes. So the spike is not necessarily a spike because it's not throwaway code, it's just a way to layer in the skills based approach in a sort of controlled manner that only effects a certain. Part of the paw. Project to the. The poll workflows. But then creates the infrastructure that then the existing PAW implementation workload, review workflow, etcetera can migrate into my. Idea on. The change is actually to. Pivot this work into. Solving this issue. 

https://github.com/lossyrob/phased-agent-workflow/issues/87

That issue is for a design agent and so it would actually update this issue and instead of building a design agent, what I'd like to do is the following. Build the baseline Paw agent that is discussed in the. Issue 153. And. Have that agent have a design skill or a set of design skills. And then we can sort of dig into what a good set of design skills are. This will also get into the design of do we have, you know, how do we have a workflow. So there's like sort of a design workflow skill that may even reference other design skills. It can also get into like sort of the custom skills as well, because if a if a user registers their own skills as sort of like in like in the description points out that their design skills. Then we can have the you know design workflow skill include you know. Instructions on hey, if the if there's any other registered skills by the user that are focused on design, then consider you know using them as well. So this is really going to be an alternate design with this skills based approach. On top of, you know, creating this baseline Paw agent. That'll only be kind of switched to. You know, if this does get merged, then we would be creating a single new instance, a single new agent called Paul. That would be the general Paw agent that we're looking to build for to, you know, to migrate everything to. But that Paul agent would get loaded with the skills catalog for the design workflow, the design skills and also the. Custom skills components. That entire infrastructure? Umm. Uh, and inside of this will decide, you know, do we load up the skills catalog with Paul Gate context? We can do that in this work. Or we can have a get skills tool call that gets the skills catalog and then we can design the, you know, correct approach about laying out what are internal paw skills versus what are custom skills that we're loading from the. Workspace or the work item or the user directory and. We can sort of think through all of that in you know and create the the foundation of what Paul will be moving to, but only focus on this sort of design pass and I'll actually end up using this design agent to talk through how to implement the rest of the skills based refactor. But yeah, I want to really focus on that and I also, you know this the implementation plan that was based on the issue 154. Kind of shows a little bit of a lack of, you know, us. I just don't understand what it's going for when it's saying that it's, you know. For phase one, adding agents to the hand off. I think that it's just, you know, trying to like the review process is kind of outside of the regular paw stuff. So I don't know if it's like saying that we would. You know, create these this handoff and then in face a later phase map them. To it, but it doesn't, it doesn't talk about removing the agents. So I just, I want to pivot in another direction and I want to be clear in the issue that this is the approach we're taking it like the end state will be. There is a, there's a paw agent that is the singular agent that is the foundation that will eventually be the only Paul agent will exist alongside the other agents for now as like the spike or like as the sort of in progress. Feature to move towards that skills based refactor. But there will be the there will be the Paw agent. The Paw agent will you know. Be able to understand the Paul process. Get the context for Paul and then the instructions about loading skills and then. Like the different you know, I think there's have to be different instructions about, you know, understanding what the user's trying to accomplish and what's what. Phase of Paul they're trying to work in, if any and. So really like the focus would be like on the design phase that is this new phase that were that were building but but this new Paw agent should be the you know infrastructure that will then layer in all of the refactors on and actually remove all the rest of the agents and and layer those as skills. But so for now it's just a single pot agent understands the Paw. Umm, workflow gets this, you know, does the first thing, which is like get the fall context. Potentially gets a skills catalog, although we could load the skills catalog in with the paw context. So that's something that will determine like during the implementation planning phase. And then, you know, then what we're building is AA, layout of that skills catalog where the skills are. The PAW phase workflow skills, which there will only be a single one for now because we're focusing on this design phase, this new design phase, so sort of Greenfield but this phase instruction skill. Should be sort of the template that now we can apply to the all of the implementation phases, the spec, writing the implementation, planning the implementation. PR, final PR like, etc. And so there's the workflow skills that are like the system, the POS system skills and then there's the Paw system skills that are like you know the design activities. So I think that that's that's a good opportunity to design out OK this there's the workflow of designing but then there's the actual like design activity skills that the agent should be able to load up dynamically as it sees fit with this progression, progressive disclosure of skills. And so there 'd be like a new tool that's like, you know, Paul gets skill. And and then again what I will want to test in this is also having a custom skill that the that like gets registered with the workspace or the user directory. Or the work item could also have like a skills folder. And so that gets loaded and then inside of this. The skills catalog has different sections for the workflow, instructions for the Paw internal skills and then the custom skills, where the custom skills actually point to the file path of the skills dot MD that the user supplied. So we just kind of crawl those locations to find the skills.Md, parse the YAML front matter, get the name and description and then include that in the catalog. But instead of having the the you know whereas the system. The Paw system skills will be loaded through a tool call the user skills. The custom skills will be loaded just by providing the path to the skills dot MD and then that way the user can like include other you know files in that skills dot MT like scripts for instance that the agent can just like read the markdown and then understand the file location so that there's like you know, a Python script alongside of the skills. It can better locate that, so that is a difference between how system skills are going to be. Fetched by the agent versus these like custom skills. So we'll design this sort of a foundation of the the skills based system. And then use the design. What was an issue about design agent but now is moving to like this design scale? This design phase, right. So we'll layer that on top and that way we can build that sort of independently without sort of touching the rest of Paul and then sort of prove that concept out, potentially merge that as you know, an independently mergable and workable feature. And then the work becomes migrating the implementation workflow, all of the phases there and all the review workflow into this new system. At which time like the the number of custom agents will go to one or. Or you know not that's not a hard what we'll have to design around that whether it be like one or two or 3 you know at most probably 2 because there maybe be Paul review and Paul you know implementation but II don't even think so I think it should just be a single paw agent so there's there's some questions to be answered that will be discovered through this work but I want to be. Clear about what I want out of this spike or like this like first task in this refactor so we're accomplishing this new work of the design skill. And also building the foundation of the skills based system.
