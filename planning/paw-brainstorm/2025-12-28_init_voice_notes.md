These are voice notes. About an idea about. Paul brainstorming. It's pretty loose idea right now, but we'll talk through it. 

So I was doing some work, some engineering work, and I had a pretty interesting idea and I was brainstorming with copilot and I just it it arrived at some stuff that was like. Kind of talking about what my idea was, but didn't quite nail it and I wasn't even sure you know. I like to have Copilot sort of be able to repeat back to me and summarize like what I'm thinking and try to consolidate so that I can kind of review and see what needs to be thought more about anyway. But I was sort of trying to offload that thinking onto the. Copilot 'cause I didn't have time. I had to, like, run and go do something. So I asked the like the next message was as a distinguished engineer. Review these this like idea and you know sort of explain like critique it and give a direct critique. So don't. You know, pull punches. I forget exactly how I phrased it, but. Mostly be like blunt and direct. About what's why it's not a good idea and. What alternatives I should consider? And and I have to add to a section of the document that I was, you know, 'cause I had the first sort of branch for everything produce a document that kind of described the idea and that was like add a new section that is this like critical assessment. And it did. And it was a really interesting take. Like, I actually. Um, you know, learned, not learned a lot, but it was like a certainly a different tone and a different way of like thinking about the problem than what the agent was doing before and. You know, I responded to that response and then asked it to do a reassessment given the sort of things that, you know, I had busily justified like I it was pretty harsh to be honest with you. Like about, you know, you shouldn't be doing this idea like this is over engineering, yadda yadda. And so I basically had to justify why I was, you know, thinking in this direction because it wasn't about the specific task that I was working on. I started the. You know, I started the thread basically in something like. Initially like was trying to accomplish a specific task and it was like, you know. Working on an interesting problem rather than solving the problem that you're trying to solve. And I'm like, well, you know, it's. I'm actually not trying to solve that problem specifically or think about things in a more general way anyway. So that was really interesting. And then I had it respond like and then I kept on putting like rolls on it like as a single engineer. Like. Do like do another response and then I wanted I was like there as a researcher, so principal researcher, you know, as if you understand what I'm what I'm saying and helping me trying to get at the core idea about what you know what my idea is, you know what I mean? II like phrase this other sort of persona as somebody who is more trying to help me crystallize that idea rather than like critique it from a engineering perspective. And that was helpful. And I'm like 0 II. Think I should think more about how to codify this process of brainstorming using a series of personas that I can sort of craft and get to know a little bit. Like give a little bit of personality and like, you know, what is their, what is their role and what do they think about, what do they care about and. You know, what type of advice are they gonna give me? Is it gonna be like tell me about my ideas bad or is it gonna like help me get at the most like theoretical part of my idea and. At different points, I think it's useful to hear those different opinions. And so thinking about assembling sort of a team of agents that have these different personas that went on brainstorming and thinking through things that can be like, well, what do you think and you know, what do you think and what you know kind of have a conversation with. And get a lot of input. And that that will just help me like think through the various aspects of a problem and so this idea of like a paw brainstorm, brainstorming workflow. Would be kind of that. 

And so in order to have that, it's, it might be pretty straightforward just as far as like there's custom agents. And they. You know, and then it's defining the process of like OK. How do we, how do we begin the topic? How do we have the individuals contribute? And what's the memory? Of like the conversation? Like is it a shared document? Are we? When do I clear context like how do we manage context in this situation because. We could just kind of like flip the agent back and forth inside of a thread and that's fine. I'm just worried about losing important information to a conversation thread and especially like if I wanted. You know, contact. S and and make sure that if a conversation goes on long enough that there's some crystallization of the the. Topic. So almost like there's just a conversation, there's like a message log that gets written. That is sort of a concise version of. The conversation or something like that. And then. Maybe even like with the agent hand off saying like you know. There's a little bit of instruction of just like if you think that another agent will have a good perspective here, suggest handing off to that agent. Otherwise you can kind of just say like what do you think Paul the Distinguished Engineer thinks and then it would just. Hand off to that agent without clearing the context. Or we could just have it manually switch the agent. Is like not a huge UX problem, but it might be. Easier if I'm maybe even trying to have the conversation through voice chat. To have the voice. Commands be able to hand off and switch the agents. So that's the idea. 

And perhaps this team could be. Useful even outside of the. Brainstorming. I'm just thinking about how if. There's agents. That can well. What do you think of is you know, the implementation plan and the spec are not reviewed in the same way that the like implementation like phase implementation is reviewed, which often it means like. Reviewing the implementation phase is actually like 1 of the least useful things, because when they're implementing the phase, it's a pretty discrete set of code that's based on the plan and so if the plan is wrong. You know, it's. That's the. That's the worst part. I don't think the spec is something that is not, you know. Necessarily the the crux. It's the implementation plan. That should have review cycles through. Agents that look at different aspects, so. If we had, you know, so there's these brainstorming team, but there's also like a implementation plan review team and they could be maybe the same people but. It really looks at your implementation plan and we have the harsh credit that's just like this is why this is won't work. Security person who's just like this is my security's bad or, you know, I think how to improve and then there has to be some way for them to collaborate on the document. Which is a tough. Or maybe not. I don't know if it's challenging or not. The simplest form is to just have each edit, each agent edit the document. Directly but then. It makes it harder to review those changes if you want to so. But you could just have commits in between and. Yeah, so do you want the agent to directly update the document or do you want it to like produce a set of notes that talks about updating the plan and then? Yeah, there's there's there's some process by which you construct an implementation plan that is at a higher abstraction level than actually implying the code, but allows for overview process that enables a team of agents to interactively build the best possible plan.
