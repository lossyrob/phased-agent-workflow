# Spec Research Prompt: Implementation Planner Improvements

Perform research to answer the following questions.

Target Branch: feature/impl-planner-improvements
Issue URL: https://github.com/lossyrob/phased-agent-workflow/issues/58
Additional Inputs: none

## Questions

1. Where are the Implementation Planner agent instructions located in the codebase? What is the file path and structure?

2. What is the current content and organization of the Implementation Planner agent instructions? What sections exist and how detailed are they?

3. How does the Implementation Planner currently structure implementation plans? What sections/phases are typically included?

4. What existing guidance does the Implementation Planner have about code detail level and when to include implementation code vs descriptions?

5. How does the Implementation Planner currently handle workflow transitions after creating a plan? What instructions exist for committing, pushing, and creating PRs?

6. What is the current behavior for PR comment formatting? Is there existing guidance about agent identification or signatures?

7. Are there examples of phase summaries or high-level overviews in other PAW agent outputs that could serve as templates?

8. What is the relationship between the Implementation Planner and the Documenter agent? Is there explicit guidance about when documentation should be created?

### Optional External / Context

1. What are industry best practices for AI agent instruction design that promote high-level strategic thinking over detailed implementation?

2. Are there established patterns for AI prompt engineering that prevent over-specification or premature optimization?
