# PAW Workflow Extension

Streamline your Phased Agent Workflow (PAW) development with automated work item initialization.

## Features

- **Initialize Work Item**: One command to create complete PAW directory structure
  - Creates `.paw/work/<feature-slug>/` with WorkflowContext.md
  - Generates all 9 prompt template files
  - Creates and checks out git branch
  - Opens WorkflowContext.md for immediate editing

## Usage

1. Open a git repository in VS Code
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)
3. Type "PAW: Initialize Work Item"
4. Enter target branch name (e.g., `feature/my-feature`)
5. Optionally enter GitHub issue URL
6. Watch as your work item structure is created automatically

## Custom Instructions

You can tailor the initialization workflow for your project by providing optional custom instructions.

### Setup

1. Create the directory:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p .paw/instructions
  ```
2. Create the instructions file:
  ```bash
  touch .paw/instructions/init-instructions.md
  ```
3. Add your project-specific guidance using Markdown. Refer to `vscode-extension/examples/init-instructions.example.md` for a template.

### What You Can Customize

- Naming conventions for feature slugs and branches
- Required metadata that must appear in `WorkflowContext.md`
- Additional prompt templates beyond the standard nine
- Integration requirements (for example, mandatory GitHub issue URLs)

When present, the extension injects the instructions into the agent prompt so the Copilot agent follows both the PAW defaults and your project rules. If the file is missing or empty, initialization proceeds with the standard behavior.

## Requirements

- Git repository
- GitHub Copilot extension installed and active
