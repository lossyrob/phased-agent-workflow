# Concise PR Descriptions

## Overview

This enhancement streamlines all PR descriptions generated by PAW agents to improve readability and encourage human review. Verbose PR descriptions were causing reviewers to skip reading them, defeating their purpose.

## Architecture and Design

### Design Decisions

**"Less is more" principle**: Verbose descriptions waste reviewer attention. Critical information should be immediately visible without scrolling.

**PR description hierarchy**:
- **Final PRs**: Most detailed (5 sections) - the primary PR humans review thoroughly
- **Intermediate PRs** (Planning/Phase/Docs): Ultra-minimal (1 line) - these exist for process, not detailed review

**Timeline comment removal**: Implementation Reviewer timeline comments weren't being read. PR descriptions already contain the essential information, making summary comments redundant.

### Changes by Agent

| Agent | PR Type | Before | After |
|-------|---------|--------|-------|
| PAW-05 PR | Final PR | 11 sections, verbose template | 5 sections: Summary, Changes, Testing, Breaking Changes, Artifacts (collapsed) |
| PAW-02B Planner | Planning PR | Multi-line summary | Single line + link to ImplementationPlan.md |
| PAW-03B Impl Reviewer | Phase PR | Objectives, changes, testing sections | Single line: phase objective |
| PAW-04 Documenter | Docs PR | Summary + artifact links | Single line: "Documentation for \<Work Title\>" |
| PAW-03B Impl Reviewer | Comments | Posted timeline summaries | No timeline comments posted |

## User Guide

### What Changed

Users will notice:
- **Shorter PR descriptions** that get to the point quickly
- **No more lengthy summary comments** on Phase PRs from the Implementation Reviewer
- **Final PRs** now have a collapsed Artifacts section keeping detail available but hidden by default

### No Action Required

This change is internal to PAW agent behavior. Users don't need to change their workflow - PRs will automatically use the new concise format.

## Technical Reference

### Intermediate PR Formats

**Planning PR**: `Planning for <Work Title>. See [ImplementationPlan.md](.paw/work/<feature-slug>/ImplementationPlan.md)`

**Phase PR**: `Phase <N>: <one-sentence objective>`

**Docs PR**: `Documentation for <Work Title>.`

All include the PAW signature footer.

## Testing Guide

### How to Verify

1. **Run a PAW workflow** on a test feature to see new PR format
2. **Check Phase PRs** - should be single line descriptions
3. **Check Final PR** - should have 5 sections, no verbose template
4. **Verify no timeline comments** - Implementation Reviewer should not post summary comments on PRs

### Automated Tests

Agent linting verifies agent file syntax:
```bash
./scripts/lint-agent.sh agents/PAW-05\ PR.agent.md
./scripts/lint-agent.sh agents/PAW-02B\ Impl\ Planner.agent.md
./scripts/lint-agent.sh agents/PAW-03B\ Impl\ Reviewer.agent.md
./scripts/lint-agent.sh agents/PAW-04\ Documenter.agent.md
```

## Edge Cases and Limitations

### Information Trade-off

Concise PRs intentionally omit some information previously included:
- Detailed acceptance criteria verification (now in artifacts only)
- Phase-by-phase implementation links (just reference artifacts folder)
- Open questions resolution details (documented in artifacts)

Reviewers needing this detail can expand the Artifacts section or navigate to the `.paw/work/<feature-slug>/` folder.

### Timeline Comment Removal

The Implementation Reviewer no longer posts summary comments on PRs. If a team requires these summaries, they would need to modify the agent prompt to restore this behavior via custom instructions.
