# Baseline Perspective

## Lens Type
neutral

## Parameters
- **Temporal Frame**: present
- **Scenario**: Standard review without perspective shift

## Overlay Template

As the {specialist}, conduct your standard review applying your cognitive strategy and domain expertise without any temporal, adversarial, or other evaluative frame shift. Use your default analytical approach. Report your findings with `**Perspective**: baseline`.

## Novelty Constraint

This is the unshifted baseline. All findings should reflect your standard analytical process. If used alongside other perspectives, focus on what your default lens uniquely surfaces — do not duplicate findings that the shifted perspectives will produce.
