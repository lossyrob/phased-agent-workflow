# Simplified Workflow Implementation Plan

## Overview

Implement configurable workflow modes (full, minimal, custom) and review strategies (prs, local) for PAW, allowing users to skip unnecessary stages and choose how to review their work (via intermediate PRs or locally on a single branch). This implementation extends the VS Code extension to capture workflow preferences, enhances the prompt template generation tool to create mode-appropriate prompt files, and updates all agent instructions to adapt behavior based on the selected mode and review strategy.

## Current State Analysis

PAW currently implements a single, comprehensive workflow path:
- **Fixed 10-stage progression**: Spec (01A) → Spec Research → Code Research (02A) → Implementation Plan (02B) → Implementation (03A-03D) → Documentation (04) → Final PR (05) → Status (0X)
- **Multi-branch strategy**: Hardcoded creation of planning branch (_plan), phase branches (_phaseN), and docs branch (_docs) with intermediate PRs
- **No workflow configuration**: All workflows follow identical stages regardless of task scope
- **Extension limitation**: Only collects target branch and optional issue URL during initialization (`vscode-extension/src/ui/userInput.ts:47-88`)
- **Tool limitation**: `paw_create_prompt_templates` generates all 10 prompt files unconditionally (`vscode-extension/src/tools/createPromptTemplates.ts:30-78`)
- **Agent uniformity**: All 10 agents follow identical WorkflowContext.md reading patterns with no mode awareness (`.github/chatmodes/PAW-*.chatmode.md`)

### Key Discoveries:
- Extension already has validation infrastructure for user inputs with typed interfaces (`WorkItemInputs`) at `vscode-extension/src/ui/userInput.ts:12-20`
- Prompt template tool is registered as a language model tool allowing agents to invoke it (`vscode-extension/src/tools/createPromptTemplates.ts:149-189`)
- All agents have defensive WorkflowContext.md creation logic that defaults to full mode with prs strategy when fields are missing (e.g., `.github/chatmodes/PAW-01A Spec Agent.chatmode.md:70-103`)
- Stage-to-prompt mapping follows consistent naming: 01A-spec, 02A-code-research, 02B-impl-plan, 03A-implement, 03B-review, 03C-pr-review, 03D-review-pr-review, 04-docs, 05-pr, 0X-status
- Git operations centralized in agent instructions (no git library usage), allowing mode-based branching to be controlled purely via instruction changes

## Desired End State

After this plan is complete:
1. Users selecting "minimal" mode during initialization generate only 6 prompt files (02A, 02B, 03A, 03B, 05, 0X) and work on single branch with local review strategy
2. Users selecting "full" mode can choose between "prs" review strategy (planning, phase, docs branches with intermediate PRs) or "local" review strategy (single branch, final PR only)
3. Users selecting "custom" mode can provide free-text instructions describing their desired workflow, and agents interpret these to generate appropriate prompt files
4. All agents read Workflow Mode and Review Strategy from WorkflowContext.md and adapt branching behavior accordingly
5. WorkflowContext.md contains `Workflow Mode: <full|minimal|custom>` and `Review Strategy: <prs|local>` and optionally `Custom Workflow Instructions: <text>`
6. Quality gates (tests, linting, type checking, build) remain mandatory regardless of mode
7. Defaults: WorkflowContext.md files without Workflow Mode or Review Strategy fields default to "full" mode with "prs" review strategy

**Verification**:
- Run `PAW: New PAW Workflow` command, select "minimal" mode → verify exactly 6 prompt files created in `.paw/work/<slug>/prompts/`
- Initialize workflow with "full" mode + "prs" strategy → verify all 10 prompt files created
- Initialize workflow with "full" mode + "local" strategy → verify all 10 prompt files created, but no intermediate branches/PRs
- Run minimal workflow end-to-end → verify no _plan, _phaseN, or _docs branches created, all commits on target branch
- Check WorkflowContext.md without Workflow Mode field → agents default to "full" mode with "prs" strategy without errors

## What We're NOT Doing

- Creating additional predefined modes beyond full, minimal, and custom in this implementation
- Changing quality gate requirements based on workflow mode (all quality checks remain mandatory)
- Supporting mid-workflow mode changes or mode transitions (requires re-initialization)
- Migrating existing in-progress workflows to new workflow mode system (applies to new workflows only)
- Implementing workflow mode selection in non-VS Code environments (CLI-only usage not supported)
- Automatic detection or recommendation of optimal workflow mode based on issue analysis
- Changing branch naming conventions (planning/phase/docs suffixes remain same in full mode)
- Adding spec research prompt file to generated templates (spec research continues to be generated dynamically by Spec Agent)

## Implementation Approach

This implementation follows a layered approach, building from data capture through tool enhancement to agent behavior adaptation:

1. **Phase 1** extends the extension to capture user's workflow mode preference and persist it in WorkflowContext.md
2. **Phase 2** enhances the prompt template generation tool to conditionally create prompt files based on workflow mode
3. **Phase 3** updates all agent instructions with mode-specific behavior, primarily for branching strategy
4. **Phase 4** adds comprehensive testing and validation

Each phase is independently testable and produces a working (though incomplete) system. This allows for iterative review and adjustment.

## Phase 1: Extension UI and WorkflowContext.md Schema

### Overview
Extend the VS Code extension to prompt users for workflow mode and review strategy selection during initialization and store both in WorkflowContext.md. This phase establishes the data model and user interface for workflow configuration.

### Changes Required:

#### 1. User Input Interface
**File**: `vscode-extension/src/ui/userInput.ts`
**Changes**:
- Add `WorkflowMode` type: string literal union of 'full', 'minimal', 'custom'
- Add `ReviewStrategy` type: string literal union of 'prs', 'local'
- Add `WorkflowModeSelection` interface with `mode: WorkflowMode` and optional `customInstructions?: string`
- Update `WorkItemInputs` interface to include `workflowMode: WorkflowModeSelection` and `reviewStrategy: ReviewStrategy` fields
- Create new `collectWorkflowMode()` function that:
  - Shows Quick Pick with 3 mode options (full, minimal, custom) with descriptions
  - If custom mode selected, prompts for custom instructions with validation (min 10 chars)
  - Returns WorkflowModeSelection object
- Create new `collectReviewStrategy()` function that:
  - Shows Quick Pick with 2 strategy options (prs, local) with descriptions
  - If minimal mode selected, skip prompt and default to 'local' (with note to user)
  - Returns ReviewStrategy value
- Update `collectUserInputs()` to call `collectWorkflowMode()` after target branch, then `collectReviewStrategy()`, before issue URL
- Add workflow mode and review strategy to returned WorkItemInputs object

#### 2. Initialization Prompt Template
**File**: `vscode-extension/src/prompts/workItemInitPrompt.template.md`
**Changes**:
- Add workflow mode template variable after ISSUE_URL variable
- Add review strategy template variable after workflow mode
- Add conditional custom instructions template variable (only rendered if present)
- Update WorkflowContext.md generation instructions to include:
  - `Workflow Mode: {{WORKFLOW_MODE}}` field
  - `Review Strategy: {{REVIEW_STRATEGY}}` field
  - Conditional `Custom Workflow Instructions: {{CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS}}` field
- Add section instructing agent to determine stages based on workflow mode:
  - Full mode → all stages
  - Minimal mode → CodeResearch, Plan, Implementation, ImplementationReview, FinalPR, Status only
  - Custom mode → interpret instructions to determine stages
- Add validation rule: minimal mode must use local review strategy

#### 3. Prompt Construction Function
**File**: `vscode-extension/src/prompts/workflowInitPrompt.ts`
**Changes**:
- Import `WorkflowModeSelection` and `ReviewStrategy` types from userInput module
- Add `workflowMode: WorkflowModeSelection` and `reviewStrategy: ReviewStrategy` parameters to `constructAgentPrompt()` function
- Add template substitution for `{{WORKFLOW_MODE}}` variable
- Add template substitution for `{{REVIEW_STRATEGY}}` variable
- Handle conditional `{{CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS}}` section:
  - If customInstructions present: replace placeholders with actual value
  - If absent: remove entire conditional section from template

#### 4. Command Handler Update
**File**: `vscode-extension/src/commands/initializeWorkItem.ts`
**Changes**:
- Pass `inputs.workflowMode` and `inputs.reviewStrategy` to `constructAgentPrompt()` call

#### 5. TypeScript Compilation
**File**: `vscode-extension/tsconfig.json`
**Verification**: Confirm `strict` mode enabled for type safety

### Success Criteria:

#### Automated Verification:
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes: `cd vscode-extension && npm run compile`
- [x] No TypeScript errors in modified files: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- [x] Extension builds successfully: `npm run compile` in vscode-extension directory

#### Manual Verification:
- [ ] Run `PAW: New PAW Workflow` command in VS Code
- [ ] Verify workflow mode selection UI appears with 3 options (full, minimal, custom)
- [ ] Verify review strategy selection UI appears with 2 options (prs, local)
- [ ] Select "minimal" mode → verify review strategy automatically set to "local" (no prompt)
- [ ] Select "full" mode + "prs" strategy → verify WorkflowContext.md created with both fields
- [ ] Select "full" mode + "local" strategy → verify WorkflowContext.md contains `Workflow Mode: full` and `Review Strategy: local`
- [ ] Select "custom" mode → verify prompted for custom instructions
- [ ] Provide custom instructions "skip docs, single branch" → verify WorkflowContext.md contains mode, strategy, and instructions
- [ ] Check that target branch and issue URL collection still work as before (no regressions)

**Phase 1 Implementation Complete - 2025-11-07**

All automated verification passed successfully. The extension now collects workflow mode and review strategy during initialization:

**Implementation Summary:**
- Added WorkflowMode ('full' | 'minimal' | 'custom') and ReviewStrategy ('prs' | 'local') types
- Created collectWorkflowMode() function with Quick Pick UI showing three mode options with descriptions
- Created collectReviewStrategy() function that auto-selects 'local' for minimal mode
- Updated WorkItemInputs interface to include workflowMode and reviewStrategy fields
- Enhanced initialization prompt template with workflow mode, review strategy, and custom instructions variables
- Updated WorkflowContext.md schema to include new fields with stage determination logic
- Modified constructAgentPrompt() to accept and substitute workflow mode/strategy parameters
- Updated initializeWorkItem command handler to pass new parameters and log selections
- Fixed test cases in customInstructions.test.ts to match new function signatures

**Key Implementation Notes:**
- Minimal mode enforces local review strategy (no intermediate PRs)
- Custom mode prompts for custom instructions with 10 character minimum validation
- Template includes clear stage determination logic for agents to follow
- All changes use optional parameters to maintain defaults when fields are missing
- Type safety enforced through TypeScript strict mode

**Review Tasks for Implementation Review Agent:**
- Verify UI text clarity and user experience flow
- Check that Quick Pick descriptions accurately describe each mode
- Validate custom instructions prompt placeholder text is helpful
- Ensure WorkflowContext.md schema documentation is complete and clear

**Manual Testing Pending:** Manual verification steps require end-to-end workflow execution across all modes and strategies. These will be verified during integration testing or by running actual workflows with different configurations. The manual testing scenarios described in the plan provide comprehensive coverage of all workflow mode and review strategy combinations.

## Phase 5: Fix Process Steps Integration for Review Strategy Handling

### Overview
Fix a critical structural issue identified during Phase 4 implementation: three agents (PAW-02B Impl Planner, PAW-03B Impl Reviewer, PAW-04 Documenter) have review strategy conditional logic in their "Workflow Mode and Review Strategy Handling" sections, but this logic is NOT integrated into their numbered "Process Steps" sections. This causes agents to follow prs strategy behavior even when local strategy is configured, resulting in unwanted intermediate branches and PRs.

### Root Cause
During Phase 3, workflow mode and review strategy handling sections were added to all agents, but the conditional branching logic was not integrated into the numbered process steps that agents actually follow during execution. The process steps still assume prs strategy exclusively, causing agents to miss the strategy check and create branches/PRs inappropriately.

**Example**: PAW-04 Documenter created Docs.md and committed it directly to the target branch instead of creating a docs branch and Docs PR, because it didn't check the Review Strategy field (which was missing, defaulting to prs strategy).

### Changes Required:

#### 1. PAW-02B Implementation Planner
**File**: `.github/chatmodes/PAW-02B Impl Planner.chatmode.md`
**Changes**: Replace Step 5 (lines ~424) with conditional logic

**Current Step 5 (Problematic)**:

   - Set strategy variable: `<prs or local>`

   **Step 5.2a: IF Review Strategy = 'prs' - Create Planning Branch and PR**:
   - Check current branch: `git branch --show-current`
   - If not on planning branch `<target_branch>_plan`:
     - Create and checkout: `git checkout -b <target_branch>_plan`
   - Verify: `git branch --show-current`

     - Title: `[<Work Title>] Planning: <brief description>`
     - Include summary of spec, research, and planning deliverables
     - Links to artifacts in `.paw/work/<feature-slug>/`
     - At bottom: `🐾 Generated with [PAW](https://github.com/lossyrob/phased-agent-workflow)`
   - Pause for human review of Planning PR

   **Step 5.2b: IF Review Strategy = 'local' - Commit to Target Branch**:
   - Check current branch: `git branch --show-current`
   - If not on target branch:
     - Checkout target branch: `git checkout <target_branch>`
   - Verify: `git branch --show-current`
   - Stage ONLY planning artifacts: `git add .paw/work/<feature-slug>/{Spec.md,SpecResearch.md,CodeResearch.md,ImplementationPlan.md}` and any prompt files created
   - Verify staged changes: `git diff --cached`
   - Commit with descriptive message
   - Push target branch: `git push <remote> <target_branch>` using github mcp git tools
   - **Skip Planning PR creation** (no intermediate PR in local strategy)
   - Planning complete, ready for implementation phases
```

#### 2. PAW-03B Implementation Reviewer
**File**: `.github/chatmodes/PAW-03B Impl Reviewer.chatmode.md`
**Changes**: Replace Step 7 (lines ~229) with conditional logic

**Current Step 7 (Problematic)**:
```markdown
7. **Push and open PR** (REQUIRED):
   - **PR Operations Context**: When opening PRs, provide branch names...
   - Push implementation branch (includes both Implementation Agent's commits and your documentation commits)
   - Open phase PR with description referencing plan
   - **Title**: `[<Work Title>] Implementation Phase <N>: <brief description>`
   - Include phase objectives, changes made, and testing performed
   - Pause for human review

   **Step 7.1: Read Review Strategy** (REQUIRED FIRST):
   - Read WorkflowContext.md to extract Review Strategy field
   - If Review Strategy missing: Log "Review Strategy not specified, defaulting to 'prs'" and proceed with prs strategy
   - Set strategy variable: `<prs or local>`

   **Step 7.2a: IF Review Strategy = 'prs' - Push Phase Branch and Create Phase PR**:
   - Verify on phase branch: `git branch --show-current` should show `<target>_phase[N]`
   - Push phase branch: `git push -u <remote> <target>_phase[N]`
   - **REQUIRED**: Create Phase PR:
     - **PR Operations Context**: Provide branch names (source: phase branch, target: Target Branch), Work Title, Issue URL

     - Artifact links: Implementation Plan at `.paw/work/<feature-slug>/ImplementationPlan.md`
     - At bottom: `🐾 Generated with [PAW](https://github.com/lossyrob/phased-agent-workflow)`
   - Pause for human review
   - Post PR timeline comment starting with `**🐾 Implementation Reviewer 🤖:**` summarizing review and commits

   **Step 7.2b: IF Review Strategy = 'local' - Push Target Branch Only**:
   - Verify on target branch: `git branch --show-current` should show `<target_branch>`
   - Push target branch: `git push <remote> <target_branch>`
   - **Skip Phase PR creation** (no intermediate PR in local strategy)
   - Document phase completion in ImplementationPlan.md notes if needed
   - Phase review complete, ready for next phase or final PR
```

#### 3. PAW-04 Documenter
**File**: `.github/chatmodes/PAW-04 Documenter.chatmode.md`
**Changes**: Replace Step 5 (lines ~193) with conditional logic

**Current Step 5 (Problematic)**:

   - Verify staged changes: `git diff --cached`
   - Commit documentation changes
   - Push branch
   - Open docs PR with description
```

**Replacement Step 5 (Fixed)**:

```

### Success Criteria:

#### Automated Verification:
- [x] All chatmode files pass linting: `./scripts/lint-chatmode.sh .github/chatmodes/*.chatmode.md`
- [x] No markdown syntax errors in updated chatmode files

#### Manual Verification:
- [ ] Initialize workflow with full mode + **local strategy**:
  - Run PAW-02B → verify planning artifacts committed to target branch, no planning branch created, no Planning PR
  - Run PAW-03A + PAW-03B → verify code committed to target branch, no phase branches created, no Phase PRs
  - Run PAW-04 → verify Docs.md committed to target branch, no docs branch created, no Docs PR
  - Check `git branch -a` → verify only target branch and remote tracking branches (no _plan, _phase, _docs branches)

- [ ] Initialize workflow with full mode + **prs strategy**:
  - Run PAW-02B → verify planning branch created, Planning PR opened to target branch
  - Run PAW-03A + PAW-03B → verify phase branches created, Phase PRs opened to target branch
  - Run PAW-04 → verify docs branch created, Docs PR opened to target branch
  - Check `git branch -a` → verify intermediate branches exist (_plan, _phaseN, _docs)

- [ ] Initialize workflow with minimal mode (enforces local strategy):
  - Run PAW-02B (skipped—no planning stage in minimal mode)
  - Run PAW-03A + PAW-03B → verify code committed to target branch, no phase branches/PRs
  - Run PAW-04 (skipped—no docs stage in minimal mode)
  - Verify only target branch used throughout

- [ ] Test defaults handling:
  - Remove Review Strategy field from WorkflowContext.md
  - Run any of the three agents
  - Verify agent logs "Review Strategy not specified, defaulting to 'prs'"
  - Verify agent follows prs strategy (creates branches and PRs)

- [ ] Test review strategy switching:
  - Start with prs strategy, complete planning with Planning PR
  - Manually change WorkflowContext.md to local strategy
  - Run implementation phase → verify works on target branch (no phase branch/PR)

### Rationale

**Why This Fix Is Critical:**
1. **Violates User Intent**: Users selecting local strategy expect single-branch workflow, but agents create intermediate branches/PRs anyway
2. **Confusing User Experience**: Agents say they support review strategies but don't actually check the configured strategy
3. **Systematic Problem**: Three agents have identical structural issue, suggesting instruction pattern needs correction
4. **Discovered Through Real Usage**: This issue was discovered when PAW-04 agent created Docs.md during Phase 4 but failed to create docs branch/PR

**Why Process Steps Need Explicit Conditionals:**
- Agents follow numbered procedural steps more literally than narrative sections
- No explicit checkpoint forces agents to check strategy before git operations
- Conditional sub-steps (5.2a vs 5.2b) make branching logic explicit and unavoidable
- "REQUIRED FIRST" markers emphasize strategy check is mandatory

**Why Not Just Reference Workflow Mode Section:**
- Separation between explanatory sections and execution steps causes agents to miss connections
- Process steps need to be self-contained for agents to follow correctly
- Duplication of logic ensures agents can't skip the strategy check

### Testing Strategy

**Automated Tests:**
- Chatmode linting: Verify all three files pass linter with no errors
- No new unit tests needed (behavior change in prompts, not code)

**Manual Tests:**
- Test matrix: 2 strategies × 3 agents = 6 test scenarios
- Plus defaults handling and strategy switching tests

### Impact Assessment

**User-Facing Impact:**
- **HIGH**: Fixes blocking bug where local strategy doesn't work as documented
- Users selecting local strategy will now correctly get single-branch workflow
- Users relying on defaults will see explicit log message about using prs strategy

**Development Impact:**
- **LOW**: Changes only affect three chatmode instruction files
- No code changes required (agents use natural language instructions)
- Pattern can be applied to future agents with similar branching behavior

### Documentation Updates

No user-facing documentation changes needed. The feature already documents that:
- prs strategy creates intermediate branches and PRs
- local strategy works on target branch with no intermediate PRs

This phase fixes the implementation to match the documented behavior.

## Phase 2: Prompt Template Tool Enhancement

### Overview
Enhance the `paw_create_prompt_templates` tool to accept workflow mode, review strategy, and optional stages parameters, enabling conditional generation of prompt files based on the selected workflow mode.

### Changes Required:

#### 1. Tool Parameter Interface
**File**: `vscode-extension/src/tools/createPromptTemplates.ts`
**Changes**:
- Add `WorkflowStage` enum with values: spec, code-research, plan, implementation, implementation-review, pr-review-response, documentation, final-pr, status
- Update `CreatePromptTemplatesParams` interface to add:
  - `workflow_mode?: string` (optional parameter for 'full' | 'minimal' | 'custom')
  - `review_strategy?: string` (optional parameter for 'prs' | 'local')
  - `stages?: WorkflowStage[]` (optional array for explicit stage list)

#### 2. Stage-to-Prompt Mapping
**File**: `vscode-extension/src/tools/createPromptTemplates.ts`
**Changes**:
- Add `PromptTemplate` interface with fields: filename, mode, instruction, stage
- Update `PROMPT_TEMPLATES` array to include `stage: WorkflowStage` field for each template
- Map templates to stages:
  - 01A-spec.prompt.md → Spec stage
  - 02A-code-research.prompt.md → CodeResearch stage
  - 02B-impl-plan.prompt.md → Plan stage
  - 03A-implement.prompt.md → Implementation stage
  - 03B-review.prompt.md → ImplementationReview stage
  - 03C-pr-review.prompt.md, 03D-review-pr-review.prompt.md → PRReviewResponse stage
  - 04-docs.prompt.md → Documentation stage
  - 05-pr.prompt.md → FinalPR stage
  - 0X-status.prompt.md → Status stage

#### 3. Stage Determination Logic
**File**: `vscode-extension/src/tools/createPromptTemplates.ts`
**Changes**:
- Create `determineStagesFromMode()` function that:
  - If `explicitStages` provided, return them (custom mode behavior)
  - If workflow_mode is 'minimal', return: CodeResearch, Plan, Implementation, ImplementationReview, FinalPR, Status
  - If workflow_mode is 'custom' without explicit stages, fall back to minimal
  - If workflow_mode is 'full' or undefined, return all stages

#### 4. Core Template Generation Update
**File**: `vscode-extension/src/tools/createPromptTemplates.ts`
**Changes**:
- In `createPromptTemplates()` function:
  - Call `determineStagesFromMode()` with workflow_mode and stages parameters
  - Filter `PROMPT_TEMPLATES` array to only templates matching determined stages
  - Generate only filtered templates (existing generation logic unchanged)

#### 5. Tool Invocation Schema Update
**File**: `vscode-extension/src/tools/createPromptTemplates.ts`
**Changes**:
- Update tool registration description to document new parameters
- Add `workflow_mode` to parametersSchema properties with enum constraint
- Add `review_strategy` to parametersSchema properties with enum constraint
- Add `stages` to parametersSchema properties as array of stage enum values
- Keep feature_slug and workspace_path as required parameters only

### Success Criteria:

#### Automated Verification:
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes: `cd vscode-extension && npm run compile`
- [x] No type errors in createPromptTemplates.ts: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- [x] Tool parameter validation accepts workflow_mode and stages parameters

#### Manual Verification:
- [ ] Initialize workflow with "full" mode + "prs" strategy → verify 10 prompt files created (01A, 02A, 02B, 03A, 03B, 03C, 03D, 04, 05, 0X)
- [ ] Initialize workflow with "full" mode + "local" strategy → verify 10 prompt files created (same as prs - review strategy doesn't affect which prompts are generated)
- [ ] Initialize workflow with "minimal" mode → verify exactly 6 prompt files created (02A, 02B, 03A, 03B, 05, 0X)
- [ ] Verify no 01A-spec.prompt.md or 04-docs.prompt.md in minimal mode
- [ ] Check that generated prompt files have correct frontmatter (`mode: PAW-XX`) and content
- [ ] Initialize workflow with "full" mode twice → verify files are overwritten correctly (idempotent)

**Phase 2 Implementation Complete - 2025-11-09**

All automated verification passed successfully. The prompt template tool now supports conditional generation based on workflow mode:

**Implementation Summary:**
- Added WorkflowStage enum with 9 stage values (spec, code-research, plan, implementation, implementation-review, pr-review-response, documentation, final-pr, status)
- Updated CreatePromptTemplatesParams interface to include optional workflow_mode, review_strategy, and stages parameters
- Created PromptTemplate interface and updated PROMPT_TEMPLATES array to map each template to its corresponding stage
- Implemented determineStagesFromMode() function with logic for:
  - Full mode: All 9 stages (10 prompt files)
  - Minimal mode: 7 stages excluding spec and documentation (7 prompt files: 02A, 02B, 03A, 03B, 03C, 03D, 05, 0X)
  - Custom mode: Uses explicit stages array or falls back to minimal
  - Undefined: Defaults to all stages
- Modified createPromptTemplates() to filter templates based on determined stages
- Updated package.json inputSchema with new optional parameters and appropriate enum constraints
- Tool registration now documents workflow mode support in modelDescription

**Key Implementation Notes:**
- Stage filtering happens at template generation time, not file creation time
- PRReviewResponse stage includes both 03C and 03D prompt files
- Review strategy parameter accepted but doesn't affect which prompts are generated (documented in comments)
- Defaults preserved: undefined workflow_mode generates all prompt files
- All parameters except feature_slug and workspace_path remain optional to support defaults when missing

**Review Tasks for Implementation Review Agent:**
- Verify stage-to-prompt-file mapping is complete and accurate
- Check that determineStagesFromMode logic correctly handles all mode cases
- Validate that package.json schema changes match TypeScript interface
- Ensure minimal mode stage count matches spec (should be 7 files, not 6 as initially stated in plan - includes PRReviewResponse stage)

**Note on Stage Count:** The implementation plan initially stated minimal mode would generate 6 files, but the actual implementation generates 7 files (02A, 02B, 03A, 03B, 03C, 03D, 05, 0X) because PRReviewResponse stage includes both 03C and 03D prompt files, which are important for handling PR review comment workflows even in minimal mode.

**Addressed Review Comments: - 2025-11-10**

Addressed PR review comment https://github.com/lossyrob/phased-agent-workflow/pull/66#discussion_r2508755646 regarding the unnecessary `review_strategy` parameter in the `paw_create_prompt_templates` tool.

**Issue**: The `review_strategy` parameter was accepted by the tool but documented as not affecting which prompt files are generated. Since the tool's sole purpose is to generate prompt files, accepting a parameter that doesn't affect its output is unnecessary and confusing.

**Resolution**: Removed `review_strategy` parameter from:
- `CreatePromptTemplatesParams` interface in `vscode-extension/src/tools/createPromptTemplates.ts`
- `inputSchema` in `vscode-extension/package.json`
- Tool `modelDescription` to remove any reference to review strategy

**Rationale**: The review strategy configuration is still collected during workflow initialization (Phase 1) and written to WorkflowContext.md. Agents will read the review strategy directly from WorkflowContext.md when they need it (Phase 3) to adapt their branching behavior. The prompt template generation tool doesn't need this information because it only determines which prompt files to create, not how branches or PRs should be managed.

**Other Parameters Verified**: Confirmed that remaining parameters are all necessary:
- `feature_slug` (required): Used to determine directory path
- `workspace_path` (required): Used to determine directory path  
- `workflow_mode` (optional): Determines which stages to include, directly affects which files are generated
- `stages` (optional): Explicit stage list, directly affects which files are generated

## Phase 3: Agent Instruction Updates

### Overview
Update all PAW agent chatmode files to include workflow mode and review strategy handling sections that adapt branching behavior and artifact discovery based on the configuration in WorkflowContext.md.

### Changes Required:

#### 1. Common Workflow Mode and Review Strategy Handling Pattern

All 10 agent chatmode files need a new "Workflow Mode and Review Strategy Handling" section added after their "WorkflowContext.md Parameters" section. Each agent's section should:
- Read both Workflow Mode and Review Strategy from WorkflowContext.md at startup
- Describe behavior for full mode (all stages)
- Describe behavior for minimal mode (subset of stages)
- Describe behavior for custom mode (interpret Custom Workflow Instructions)
- Describe behavior for prs review strategy (create intermediate branches and PRs)
- Describe behavior for local review strategy (single branch, no intermediate PRs)
- Handle defaults (missing fields default to full mode with prs strategy)

#### 2. PAW-01A Spec Agent
**File**: `.github/chatmodes/PAW-01A Spec Agent.chatmode.md`
**Changes**: Add workflow mode and review strategy handling section after WorkflowContext.md Parameters
**Behavior**:
- Full mode: Standard spec creation with Spec.md and SpecResearch.md
- Minimal mode: Agent should not be invoked (spec stage skipped)
- Custom mode: Check if spec stage included in instructions
- Review Strategy: prs or local both work the same for spec stage (no branching yet)
- Defaults: Default to full mode with prs strategy if fields missing

#### 3. PAW-02A Code Researcher
**File**: `.github/chatmodes/PAW-02A Code Researcher.chatmode.md`
**Changes**: Add workflow mode handling section
**Behavior**:
- Full mode: Read Spec.md and SpecResearch.md for context
- Minimal mode: Use Issue URL as requirements source (Spec.md may not exist)
- Add artifact discovery logic: check if Spec.md exists before reading
- If Spec.md missing in minimal/custom mode, note it and continue

#### 4. PAW-02B Impl Planner
**File**: `.github/chatmodes/PAW-02B Impl Planner.chatmode.md`
**Changes**: Add workflow mode and review strategy handling and update branching instructions
**Behavior**:
- Full mode: All stages in plan
- Minimal mode: Single implementation phase only
- prs strategy: Create planning branch (`<target>_plan`), open Planning PR
- local strategy: Work on target branch, no planning branch, no Planning PR
- Custom mode: Interpret phase count and branch strategy from instructions

#### 5. PAW-03A Implementer
**File**: `.github/chatmodes/PAW-03A Implementer.chatmode.md`
**Changes**: Add workflow mode and review strategy handling and update phase branch creation logic
**Behavior**:
- Full mode: Multi-phase implementation typical
- Minimal mode: Single-phase implementation only
- prs strategy: Create phase branches (`<target>_phase[N]`), open Phase PRs
- local strategy: Work on target branch, no phase branches, no Phase PRs
- Custom mode: Interpret phase count and branch strategy from instructions

#### 6. PAW-03B Impl Reviewer
**File**: `.github/chatmodes/PAW-03B Impl Reviewer.chatmode.md`
**Changes**: Add workflow mode and review strategy handling for PR creation
**Behavior**:
- Full mode: Review all phases
- Minimal mode: Review single phase
- prs strategy: Push phase branch, create Phase PR
- local strategy: Push target branch, no Phase PR
- Custom mode: Adapt based on phase count and branch strategy

#### 7. PAW-04 Documenter
**File**: `.github/chatmodes/PAW-04 Documenter.chatmode.md`
**Changes**: Add workflow mode and review strategy handling
**Behavior**:
- Full mode: Create comprehensive documentation
- Minimal mode: Agent should not be invoked (docs stage skipped)
- prs strategy: Create docs branch (`<target>_docs`), open Docs PR
- local strategy: Work on target branch, commit docs directly, no Docs PR
- Custom mode: Check if docs included, adapt branch strategy

#### 8. PAW-05 PR Agent
**File**: `.github/chatmodes/PAW-05 PR.chatmode.md`
**Changes**: Add workflow mode and review strategy handling (final PR always created)
**Behavior**:
- Full mode: May reference planning, phase, and docs artifacts
- Minimal mode: Reference only code research and implementation artifacts
- prs strategy: Reference all intermediate PRs in description
- local strategy: No intermediate PRs to reference, describe work directly
- Custom mode: Adapt PR description based on which PRs exist
- Note: Final PR creation is mandatory in all modes and strategies

#### 9. PAW-0X Status Agent
**File**: `.github/chatmodes/PAW-X Status Update.chatmode.md`
**Changes**: Add workflow mode and review strategy handling for status reporting
**Behavior**:
- Full mode: Report all stages and all branches
- Minimal mode: Report only included stages, single branch
- prs strategy: Check for planning, phase, and docs branches and PRs
- local strategy: Check only target branch and final PR
- Custom mode: Infer stages from instructions and existing artifacts, adapt branch/PR checking

### Success Criteria:

#### Automated Verification:
- [x] All chatmode files pass linting: `./scripts/lint-chatmode.sh .github/chatmodes/*.chatmode.md`
- [x] No markdown syntax errors in updated chatmode files

#### Manual Verification:
- [ ] Initialize minimal workflow → run 02A-code-research.prompt.md → verify agent doesn't error about missing Spec.md
- [ ] Complete minimal workflow end-to-end → verify no planning branch, phase branches, or docs branch created
- [ ] Run `git branch -a` after minimal workflow → see only target branch and remote tracking branches
- [ ] Initialize full workflow with prs strategy → verify all agents create appropriate branches (_plan, _phaseN, _docs)
- [ ] Initialize full workflow with local strategy → verify all agents work on target branch, no intermediate branches
- [ ] Test defaults: Remove "Workflow Mode" and "Review Strategy" from WorkflowContext.md → run agent → verify defaults to "full" mode with "prs" strategy with log message
- [ ] Initialize custom workflow with "single branch, skip docs" (local strategy implied) → verify agents adapt correctly

**Phase 3 Implementation Complete - 2025-11-10**

All automated verification passed successfully. All 8 PAW agent chatmode files now include comprehensive workflow mode and review strategy handling:

**Implementation Summary:**
- Added "Workflow Mode and Review Strategy Handling" section to all agent chatmode files after WorkflowContext.md Parameters
- Each agent now adapts behavior based on Workflow Mode (full, minimal, custom) and Review Strategy (prs, local)
- Implemented branching logic differences:
  - **prs strategy**: Creates intermediate branches (_plan, _phaseN, _docs) and corresponding PRs
  - **local strategy**: Works directly on target branch, no intermediate branches or PRs
- Added artifact discovery patterns for agents to gracefully handle missing artifacts in minimal/custom modes:
  - Code Researcher checks for Spec.md existence before reading (uses Issue URL if missing)
  - PR Agent dynamically checks which artifacts exist before including in PR description
  - Status Agent reports only relevant artifacts based on mode
- Implemented phase count adaptation:
  - **full mode**: Multi-phase implementation approach
  - **minimal mode**: Single-phase implementation only
  - **custom mode**: Interprets Custom Workflow Instructions for phase structure
- Added comprehensive defaults handling:
  - Missing mode/strategy fields default to full mode with prs strategy
  - Agents log informational messages when using defaults
  - Works seamlessly when fields are not explicitly specified

**Key Implementation Notes:**
- PAW-02B Impl Planner renamed its existing "Workflow Modes" section to "Agent Operating Modes" to distinguish from PAW workflow mode handling
- All agents follow consistent pattern: read mode/strategy at startup, adapt behavior accordingly
- Minimal mode enforces local strategy (no intermediate PRs)
- Documentation stage typically skipped in minimal mode but can be invoked if needed
- Final PR creation is mandatory in all modes and strategies
- All lint checks passed (token count warnings expected and acceptable)

**Review Tasks for Implementation Review Agent:**
- Verify consistency of workflow mode handling sections across all agents
- Check that branching logic clearly differentiates prs vs local strategies
- Validate artifact discovery patterns handle missing files gracefully
- Ensure defaults are well-documented
- Confirm phase count adaptation logic is clear and correct

**Manual Testing Pending:** Manual verification steps require end-to-end workflow execution and cannot be completed during Phase 3 implementation. These will be verified during Phase 4 integration testing or by running actual workflows with different mode configurations.

## Phase 4: Testing, Validation, and Documentation

### Overview
Add comprehensive testing for all workflow modes, implement validation for invalid configurations, and update user-facing documentation with workflow mode selection guidance.

### Changes Required:

#### 1. Extension Unit Tests
**File**: `vscode-extension/src/test/suite/userInput.test.ts`
**Changes**: Add test suite for workflow mode selection
**Tests**:
- WorkflowMode type accepts valid values (full, minimal, custom)

**Changes**: Create comprehensive test suite
**Tests**:
- Full mode generates all 10 prompt files
- Minimal mode generates exactly 6 files (02A, 02B, 03A, 03B, 05, 0X)
- Custom mode with explicit stages generates only specified files
- Default behavior (no mode) generates all files
- Generated files have correct frontmatter format
- Status stage handling in different modes

#### 3. Documentation Updates
**File**: `README.md`
**Changes**: Add "Workflow Modes" section after existing content
**Content**:
- Overview of three modes (full, minimal, custom)
- When to use each mode
- How to select mode during initialization
- Clarification that quality gates remain mandatory
- Examples for each mode

#### 4. Validation and Error Handling
**Location**: Agent chatmode files (already added in Phase 3)
**Purpose**: Validate Workflow Mode field, provide clear errors for invalid values

#### 5. Error Handling Test Cases
**File**: `vscode-extension/src/test/suite/errorHandling.test.ts` (new file)
**Changes**: Test error conditions
**Tests**:
- Custom mode requires instructions
- Invalid mode string in WorkflowContext.md detected
- Clear error messages for configuration issues

### Success Criteria:

#### Automated Verification:
- [x] All unit tests pass: `cd vscode-extension && npm test`
- [x] New test files compile without errors: `npm run compile`
- [x] Test coverage includes workflow mode selection, prompt generation, and validation

#### Manual Verification:
- [ ] Complete full workflow end-to-end with prs strategy → verify all intermediate branches and PRs created
- [ ] Complete full workflow end-to-end with local strategy → verify single branch, no intermediate PRs
- [ ] Complete minimal workflow end-to-end → verify single branch, no intermediate PRs, 7 prompt files (02A, 02B, 03A, 03B, 03C, 03D, 05, 0X)
- [ ] Initialize custom workflow with specific instructions → verify correct prompt files generated and behavior matches instructions
- [ ] Test invalid mode in WorkflowContext.md → verify clear error message displayed
- [ ] Test defaults: Use WorkflowContext.md without mode/strategy fields → verify defaults to full mode with prs strategy
- [ ] Run Status Agent in each mode → verify reports appropriate status for that mode
- [ ] Verify quality gates enforced in all modes (tests, linting, type checking)
- [ ] Check documentation clarity: Can a new user understand how to select appropriate mode?

**Phase 4 Implementation Complete - 2025-11-10**

All automated verification passed successfully. Comprehensive testing infrastructure is now in place for workflow modes:

**Implementation Summary:**
- Created comprehensive unit tests in `vscode-extension/src/test/suite/userInput.test.ts` for:
  - WorkflowMode type validation (full, minimal, custom)
  - WorkflowModeSelection interface with and without custom instructions
  - ReviewStrategy type validation (prs, local)
- Created comprehensive prompt template tool tests in `vscode-extension/src/test/suite/createPromptTemplates.test.ts`:
  - Full mode: 10 prompt files generated
  - Minimal mode: 8 prompt files generated (02A, 02B, 03A, 03B, 03C, 03D, 05, 0X - includes PRReviewResponse stage)
  - Custom mode: only specified stages generated
  - Default behavior: all files when mode not specified
  - Frontmatter format validation
  - Status stage always included
  - Idempotent file generation
  - PRReviewResponse stage includes both 03C and 03D files
- Created error handling tests in `vscode-extension/src/test/suite/errorHandling.test.ts`:
  - Custom mode validation at UI level (10 character minimum)
  - TypeScript compile-time safety for mode and strategy types
  - Runtime validation of workflow mode strings
  - Minimal mode + prs strategy prevention
  - Clear error messages for missing WorkflowContext.md fields
- Updated README.md with comprehensive "Workflow Modes" section:
  - Full mode description with both prs and local strategies
  - Minimal mode description (enforces local strategy)
  - Custom mode description
  - Review strategy explanations (prs vs local)
  - When to use each mode
  - Quality gates remain mandatory note
- All 31 unit tests passing
- TypeScript compilation passes with no errors

**Key Implementation Notes:**
- Minimal mode generates 8 files (not 6 or 7 as initially estimated) because PRReviewResponse stage includes both 03C and 03D prompt files
- Tests use temporary directories for file system operations to avoid polluting the workspace
- Error handling tests focus on validation logic since TypeScript provides compile-time type safety
- README.md documentation provides clear guidance for new users on mode selection

**Review Tasks for Implementation Review Agent:**
- Verify test coverage is comprehensive and matches all implemented features
- Check that README.md documentation is clear and helpful for new users
- Validate that error messages in tests match actual error messages users would see
- Ensure test cleanup (teardown) functions work correctly across all test suites

**Manual Testing Pending:** Manual verification steps require end-to-end workflow execution across all modes and strategies. These will be verified during integration testing or by running actual workflows with different configurations. The manual testing scenarios described in the plan provide comprehensive coverage of all workflow mode and review strategy combinations.

**Addressed Review Comments: - 2025-11-10**

Addressed PR review comment https://github.com/lossyrob/phased-agent-workflow/pull/68#discussion_r2511200653 requesting that the README.md workflow modes section be more terse, with detailed documentation moved to paw-specification.md.

**Changes Made:**
1. **README.md**: Condensed the "Workflow Modes" section from ~70 lines to ~15 lines. The new section provides:
   - Brief overview of the three modes (Full, Minimal, Custom)
   - High-level summary of what each mode does
   - Quick reference to workflow selection during initialization
   - Link to paw-specification.md for detailed information
   
2. **paw-specification.md**: Added comprehensive "Workflow Modes" section (~130 lines) after the Overview and before Repository Layout, including:
   - Detailed description of Full mode with stages, best use cases, and review strategy options
   - Detailed description of Minimal mode with skipped stages, best use cases, and enforced local strategy
   - Detailed description of Custom mode with flexibility and example instructions
   - Comprehensive review strategies section explaining PRs vs Local with branch structures, workflows, trade-offs
   - Workflow mode selection process
   - Quality gates clarification (mandatory regardless of mode)
   - Backward compatibility notes

**Rationale**: The README.md is the entry point for users and should provide quick orientation. The paw-specification.md is the authoritative reference where users go for detailed understanding of concepts. Moving detailed workflow mode documentation to the specification reduces README.md length while ensuring comprehensive documentation exists in the appropriate location.

**Review Tasks**: Verify that the README.md workflow modes section is sufficiently informative for quick understanding while remaining concise, and that the paw-specification.md section provides complete detail for users who need deeper understanding.

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

**Extension Tests** (`vscode-extension/src/test/suite/`):
- Workflow mode type validation
- Review strategy type validation
- WorkflowModeSelection interface usage
- User input collection with mode and strategy parameters
- Prompt template generation with different modes
- Stage-to-prompt-file mapping correctness
- Validation rule: minimal mode requires local strategy

**Key Test Cases**:
1. Full mode + prs strategy generates exactly 10 prompt files
2. Full mode + local strategy generates exactly 10 prompt files
3. Minimal mode (local strategy enforced) generates exactly 7 prompt files (02A, 02B, 03A, 03B, 03C, 03D, 05, 0X)
4. Custom mode with explicit stages generates only specified files
5. Default behavior (no mode/strategy) generates all files (defaults to full + prs)
6. Generated files have correct frontmatter and content format
7. Invalid custom instructions rejected during input collection
8. Minimal mode + prs strategy combination rejected with clear error

### Manual Testing and Validation

Agent behavior verification across different workflow modes and review strategies requires manual end-to-end testing. There is no automated integration test framework for PAW workflows at this time.

**Manual Verification Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Minimal Mode (Single Branch, No Intermediate PRs)**
- Initialize workflow with minimal mode
- Verify exactly 7 prompt files generated (02A, 02B, 03A, 03B, 03C, 03D, 05, 0X)
- Execute Code Research agent → verify no error about missing Spec.md
- Execute Implementation Plan agent → verify single-phase plan created
- Execute Implementer agent → verify work happens on target branch (no phase branches)
- Verify all commits on target branch only
- Execute PR agent → verify Final PR created from target branch to base

**Scenario 2: Full Mode + prs Strategy (Multiple Branches and PRs)**
- Initialize workflow with full mode and prs strategy
- Verify all 10 prompt files generated
- Execute Planning agent → verify planning branch created and Planning PR opened
- Execute Implementer agent → verify phase branches created and Phase PRs opened
- Execute Documentation agent → verify docs branch created and Docs PR opened
- Execute PR agent → verify Final PR created
- Verify all intermediate branches exist (_plan, _phaseN, _docs)

**Scenario 3: Full Mode + local Strategy (Single Branch, Multiple Stages)**
- Initialize workflow with full mode and local strategy
- Verify all 10 prompt files generated
- Execute all agents sequentially
- Verify all work happens on target branch (no _plan, _phaseN, _docs branches)
- Verify only Final PR created (no Planning PR, Phase PRs, Docs PR)
- Verify all artifacts created and committed to target branch

**Scenario 4: Custom Mode with prs Strategy**
- Initialize with custom instructions: "Skip specification stage, include documentation, use prs review strategy"
- Verify prompt files generated match instructions (no 01A-spec, includes 04-docs)
- Execute agents → verify planning and phase branches created
- Verify intermediate PRs created according to prs strategy

**Scenario 5: Defaults Handling**
- Use WorkflowContext.md without Workflow Mode or Review Strategy fields
- Execute any agent → verify defaults to full mode with prs strategy
- Verify informational log message about using default values
- Verify no errors or crashes

**Scenario 6: Invalid Configuration Handling**
- Manually edit WorkflowContext.md with invalid mode value (e.g., "Workflow Mode: turbo-fast")
- Execute any agent → verify clear error message listing valid modes
- Verify agent stops execution and doesn't proceed with invalid config

**Scenario 7: Quality Gates Enforcement**
- Execute workflow in any mode with intentional test failure
- Verify tests must pass before PR can be merged
- Verify linting, type checking, and build checks enforced regardless of mode

## Performance Considerations

- **Prompt File Generation**: File I/O operations are synchronous but should be fast (generating 10 small text files). No optimization needed unless extension feels slow during initialization.
- **WorkflowContext.md Reading**: All agents read this file at startup. File size is minimal (<1KB) so no performance concerns.
- **Branch Operations**: Git operations (checkout, branch creation) are delegated to agents via terminal commands. Performance depends on repository size, but no new overhead introduced.
- **User Input Collection**: Sequential prompts may feel slower than form-based input. Consider multi-step input box if user feedback indicates UX issue.

## Defaults Handling

### WorkflowContext.md Without Mode/Strategy Fields
- WorkflowContext.md files without Workflow Mode or Review Strategy fields work seamlessly
- Agents use default values: full mode with prs strategy
- No migration required for `.paw/work/` directories
- Users can optionally add explicit `Workflow Mode: full` and `Review Strategy: prs` to WorkflowContext.md files for clarity

### For Future Mode Additions
- To add new predefined mode:
  1. Add mode name to `WorkflowMode` type in `userInput.ts`
  2. Add mode to Quick Pick items with description
  3. Add case to `determineStagesFromMode()` in `createPromptTemplates.ts`
  4. Update all agent chatmode files with new mode section
  5. Update documentation and tests
- No breaking changes required for existing modes

### Extension Version Compatibility
- Extension version should be bumped to indicate workflow mode support
- package.json version: Consider 1.1.0 (minor version bump for new feature)
- VS Code version requirement: No change (existing APIs sufficient)
