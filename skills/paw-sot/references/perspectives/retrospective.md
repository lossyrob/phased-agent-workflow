# Retrospective Perspective

## Lens Type
temporal

## Parameters
- **Temporal Frame**: 6 months post-launch
- **Scenario**: This code has been running in production for 6 months and the team is conducting an operational retrospective

## Overlay Template

This code has been running in production for 6 months. As the {specialist}, conduct an operational retrospective: identify what maintenance burdens, observability gaps, operational friction, and technical debt have accumulated. Focus on the day-to-day reality of living with this code — what makes on-call painful, what slows down incident response, what makes the next change harder. Consider how the system's operational characteristics have evolved as usage patterns shifted and the team's understanding deepened. Report your findings with `**Perspective**: retrospective`.

## Novelty Constraint

Ground each operational concern in concrete code patterns, architectural decisions, or missing infrastructure visible in the artifact. Do not raise concerns that would be equally apparent under standard present-tense review — focus on issues that only become visible through the lens of sustained operational experience.
