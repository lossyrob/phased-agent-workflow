I want to make a change to this work - it's in the final PR stage.
The term "feature slug name" is used in multiple places, but I want to change it to "work ID". This makes it more clear for users, and less on "feature" as they might be bug fixes.
Make a note in the implementation plan and spec if necessary about this change.
Internal references to "feature slug name" should be updated to "work ID".
Also its appearance in prompts, prompt files, and the paw specification.
The work ID description can mention "slug" or "feature slug" as useful for defining what a work ID is, but the primary term should be "work ID".
