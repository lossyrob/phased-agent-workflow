# Project-Specific Initialization Rules

- Include the component prefix (e.g., "api-", "ui-", "db-")

## Required Metadata

Always include the following in WorkflowContext.md Additional Inputs field:
- Component: [api|ui|db|infra]

## Branch Naming

Target branches must follow the pattern:
- feature/<component>-<slug>
- bugfix/<component>-<slug>

## Custom Prompt Templates

This project uses additional prompt templates beyond the standard 9:

## GitHub Integration

Always require a GitHub issue URL for this project. The Work Title must match the issue title exactly (no abbreviations or modifications).
