# Phased Agent Workflow (PAW)

**PAW** is a VS Code extension that coordinates multi-stage AI agent workflows for feature implementation and code review. It transforms complex development tasks into structured, verifiable phases with clear handoffs between specialized agents.

Whether you're implementing a new feature or reviewing existing code, PAW guides you through a consistent workflow—from specification to final pull request—ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.
