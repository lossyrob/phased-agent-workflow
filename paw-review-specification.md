## Overview

The **PAW Review Workflow** is a structured, three-stage process for thoughtful code review of any pull request. It helps reviewers understand changes, evaluate their impact, identify gaps, and provide considerate, actionable feedback—especially valuable for large or poorly-documented PRs.

PAW Review applies the same principles as the implementation workflow: **traceable reasoning**, **rewindable analysis**, and **human-in-the-loop decision making**. Instead of building code forward from a spec, it works backward from implementation to understanding, then strategically decides what feedback to provide.

**Key properties**

* **Understanding before critique** – Analyze what changed and why before evaluating quality
* **Comprehensive feedback** – Generate all findings; human filters and adjusts based on context
* **Artifact-based** – Durable markdown documents trace reasoning from changes to comments
* **Rewindable** – Any stage can restart if new information changes understanding
* **Human-controlled** – Nothing posted automatically; reviewer selects what to post and can ask agent to adjust tone

## Workflow Stages

### Stage R1 — Understanding

**Goal:** Comprehensively understand what changed and why

**Agents:** 
* PAW-R1A Understanding Agent
* PAW-R1B Baseline Researcher Agent (invoked during R1 research pause)

**Inputs:**
* PR URL or number (GitHub context)
* Base branch name (non-GitHub context, with current branch as head)
* Repository context

**Outputs:**
* `.paw/reviews/<identifier>/ReviewContext.md` – PR metadata, changed files, flags (authoritative parameter source)
* `.paw/reviews/<identifier>/prompts/code-research.prompt.md` – Generated research questions about pre-change system
* `.paw/reviews/<identifier>/CodeResearch.md` – Pre-change baseline understanding (created after research)
* `.paw/reviews/<identifier>/DerivedSpec.md` – Reverse-engineered intent and acceptance criteria

**Process:**

1. **Fetch PR metadata and create ReviewContext.md**
   - **GitHub**: Use GitHub MCP tools for PR metadata, files, status
   - **Non-GitHub**: Use git diff for changes, derive from commits
   - Document all changed files with additions/deletions
   - Set flags: CI failures, breaking changes suspected
   - **ReviewContext.md becomes authoritative parameter source** for all downstream stages

2. **Generate code research prompt**
   - Identify areas needing baseline understanding based on changed files
   - Create `prompts/code-research.prompt.md` with questions about:
     - Pre-change behavior of modified modules
     - Integration points and dependencies
     - Patterns and conventions
     - Performance context for sensitive code
     - Test coverage baseline
   - Guidance for PAW-R1B Baseline Researcher Agent, not rigid template

3. **Pause for baseline research**
   - Signal human to run PAW-R1B Baseline Researcher Agent
   - Wait until `CodeResearch.md` exists
   - Researcher analyzes codebase at base commit (pre-change state)

4. **Derive specification**
   - Use CodeResearch.md to understand how system worked before changes
   - Reverse-engineer author intent from code analysis and PR description
   - Extract acceptance criteria from implementation
   - Document observable before/after behavior
   - Distinguish stated goals (PR description) vs inferred goals (code analysis)
   - **Block if open questions remain** - no placeholders, no "TBD"

**Human Workflow:**

* Invoke PAW-R1A Understanding Agent with PR number or base branch
* Agent creates ReviewContext.md and code-research.prompt.md
* Run PAW-R1B Baseline Researcher Agent to analyze pre-change system
* Agent completes DerivedSpec.md using baseline understanding
* Review artifacts to ensure understanding is accurate
* Correct any misinterpretations in `DerivedSpec.md`
* Proceed to Stage R2 once understanding complete and zero open questions

---

### Stage R2 — Evaluation

**Goal:** Assess impact and identify what might be missing or concerning

**Agents:** 
* PAW-R2A Impact Analysis Agent
* PAW-R2B Gap Analysis Agent

**Inputs:**
* All Stage R1 artifacts (ReviewContext.md, CodeResearch.md, DerivedSpec.md)
* Repository codebase at base and head commits

**Outputs:**
* `.paw/reviews/<identifier>/ImpactAnalysis.md` – System-wide effects, integration points, breaking changes, design/architecture assessment
* `.paw/reviews/<identifier>/GapAnalysis.md` – Findings organized by Must/Should/Could with evidence, including positive observations

**Process:**

1. **Analyze impact** (PAW-R2A Impact Analysis Agent)
   - Build integration graph: parse imports/exports, identify public API surfaces, map downstream consumers
   - Detect breaking changes: function signature diffs, config schema changes, data model modifications
   - Assess performance: new loops/recursion, database queries, algorithmic complexity
   - Review security: auth middleware changes, permission checks, input validation
   - **Assess design & architecture**: Does this belong in codebase vs library? Integrates well with system? Timing appropriate?
   - **Evaluate user impact**: End-users (UX, performance) and developer-users (API clarity, ease of use)
   - **Code health trend**: Improving or degrading system health? Technical debt impact?
   - Document deployment considerations and risk assessment

2. **Identify gaps** (PAW-R2B Gap Analysis Agent)
   - **Correctness:** Logic errors, edge cases, error handling, invariants
   - **Safety & Security:** Input validation, authorization checks, concurrency, data integrity
   - **Testing:** Coverage quantitative (if available) and qualitative (depth/breadth), test effectiveness (will fail when broken)
   - **Maintainability:** Code clarity, documentation completeness (user-facing), orphaned docs, **comment quality** (WHY vs WHAT)
   - **Performance:** N+1 queries, unbounded operations, resource usage
   - **Complexity:** **Over-engineering** (solving future vs current problems, unnecessary abstractions)
   - **Style & Conventions:** Style guide adherence with "Nit:" labeling for preferences
   - **Positive Observations:** Identify and commend good practices for mentoring value

3. **Categorize findings**
   - **Must** – Correctness, safety, security, data integrity issues with concrete impact evidence
   - **Should** – Quality, completeness, testing gaps that increase robustness
   - **Could** – Optional enhancements with clear benefit
   - **Evidence required**: All findings have file:line references
   - **Not inflated**: Style preferences not elevated to Must without clear impact

**Human Workflow:**

* Invoke PAW-R2A Impact Analysis Agent
* Review `ImpactAnalysis.md` to understand system-wide effects, design fit, user impact
* Invoke PAW-R2B Gap Analysis Agent
* Review `GapAnalysis.md` findings in each category
* Review positive observations section
* Validate categorization feels appropriate (not inflated)
* Add domain-specific concerns the agents might have missed
* Proceed to Stage R3 to generate feedback

---

### Stage R3 — Feedback Generation

**Goal:** Generate comprehensive, well-structured review comments with rationale and critical assessment

**Agents:**
* PAW-R3A Feedback Generation Agent
* PAW-R3B Feedback Critic

**Inputs:**
* All prior artifacts (ReviewContext.md, CodeResearch.md, DerivedSpec.md, ImpactAnalysis.md, GapAnalysis.md)

**Outputs:**
* `.paw/reviews/<identifier>/ReviewComments.md` – Complete feedback with rationale and assessment sections (for reference)
* **GitHub pending review** (GitHub context only) – Draft review with inline comments posted but not submitted

**Process:**

1. **Generate comprehensive feedback** (PAW-R3A Feedback Generation Agent)
   - Batch related findings (One Issue, One Comment policy)
   - Transform all findings from GapAnalysis.md into review comments
   - Include Must, Should, and Could items
   - Provide specific, actionable suggestions with code examples
   - **Add Rationale sections** to each comment in ReviewComments.md:
     - Evidence: file:line references
     - Baseline Pattern: from CodeResearch.md
     - Impact: what could go wrong
     - Best Practice: citation from established guidelines
   - Distinguish inline comments (line-specific) from thread comments (file/concept-level)

2. **Create ReviewComments.md and pending review**
   - Save comprehensive ReviewComments.md with all feedback, rationale sections
   - **GitHub context**: Create pending review using GitHub MCP tools
     - Post inline comments with text and code suggestions only (no rationale)
     - Rationale sections remain in ReviewComments.md
   - **Non-GitHub context**: All feedback in ReviewComments.md with manual posting instructions

3. **Critical assessment** (PAW-R3B Feedback Critic)
   - Add **Assessment sections** to each comment in ReviewComments.md (local only, never posted):
     - Usefulness: Does this truly improve code quality?
     - Accuracy: Are evidence references correct?
     - Alternative Perspectives: What might the reviewer have missed?
     - Trade-offs: Valid reasons for current approach?
     - Recommendation: Include/modify/skip?
   - Assessments help reviewer make informed decisions
   - **Never post assessments to GitHub or external platforms**

4. **Support Q&A and tone adjustment**
   - Answer reviewer questions based on all artifacts
   - Regenerate pending review with adjusted tone if requested
   - Preserve IDs, evidence, rationale when adjusting tone

**Human Workflow:**

* Invoke PAW-R3A Feedback Generation Agent
  - Creates ReviewComments.md with rationale sections
  - GitHub: Creates pending review with inline comments (text/suggestions only)
  - Non-GitHub: Provides manual posting instructions
* Invoke PAW-R3B Feedback Critic
  - Adds assessment sections to ReviewComments.md
* **GitHub context**: 
  - Open PR in GitHub Files Changed tab
  - View all pending review comments
  - Edit comment text to adjust tone/wording
  - Delete unwanted comments that don't fit context
  - Add new comments if needed
  - Submit review when satisfied (Approve/Comment/Request Changes)
* **Non-GitHub context**:
  - Use ReviewComments.md to manually post to review platform
  - Post only comment text and suggestions (keep rationale/assessment for reference)
* **Optional**: Ask agent to adjust tone - regenerates pending review with new tone
* **Optional**: Ask agent questions about findings - answers based on artifacts

  - Missing null check at a particular location
  - Incorrect usage of an API
  - Performance issue in a specific loop
  - Missing test for a specific code path

- **Thread comments** – Add manually to the review body or as follow-up:
  - Overall file organization or structure
  - Missing integration tests across components
  - Architectural concerns affecting multiple files
  - Consistent pattern violations throughout
  - Cross-cutting concerns (logging, error handling approach)

**Purpose:** 
- Serves as reference copy of all generated comments
- Documents what was posted to the pending review
- Includes thread-level comments that need manual posting
- Can be used to regenerate comments if pending review is deleted

---

## Guardrails

### Review Understanding Agent

**Documentation, Not Critique:**
- NEVER critique or suggest improvements during understanding phase
- ONLY document what exists and what changed
- DO NOT make assumptions about unstated intent; flag ambiguities explicitly
- ALWAYS distinguish between stated goals (from PR description) and inferred goals (from code analysis)
- DO NOT skip reading the full PR description, linked issues, and commit messages
- NEVER fabricate intent; if unclear, mark as "Open Question" in DerivedSpec

**Mechanical Change Detection:**
- ALWAYS identify and separate mechanical changes (formatting, renames) from semantic changes
- DO NOT treat mechanical changes as requiring deep review
- Collapse mechanical changes into brief acknowledgment

**Accuracy:**
- Read files completely to understand context (no partial reads)
- Include specific file:line references for all observations
- Cross-reference PR description claims against actual code changes
- Note discrepancies between stated and implemented behavior

---

### Review Evaluation Agent

**Evidence-Based Analysis:**
- NEVER inflate severity to justify more comments
- ALWAYS provide concrete evidence (file:line references, test results, data)
- DO NOT flag style preferences as "Must" items
- Distinguish between actual gaps and "not how I would do it"
- ONLY categorize as "Must" if there's a clear correctness, safety, or security impact

**Baseline Research:**
- Research the codebase at the base commit to understand pre-change state
- Document patterns and conventions that existed before
- DO NOT recommend changes that conflict with established patterns without strong rationale
- Check for similar implementations in the codebase for consistency

**Impact Analysis:**
- Map all integration points and downstream effects
- Check for breaking changes in public APIs
- Identify data migration requirements
- Consider deployment and rollout implications
- NEVER assume changes are isolated; verify

**Gap Identification:**
- Focus on objective gaps: missing tests, unhandled errors, unchecked inputs
- Check edge cases, error paths, and boundary conditions
- Verify test coverage for new code paths
- Look for race conditions, concurrency issues, resource leaks
- DO NOT invent requirements not in the DerivedSpec

---

### Review Feedback Agent

**Human Control:**
- NEVER submit the review automatically; always create as pending
- ALWAYS save a reference copy to ReviewComments.md
- DO NOT filter findings based on assumptions about relationship or context
- Include ALL findings from GapAnalysis.md organized by Must/Should/Could
- Post all inline comments to the pending review
- Human will delete, edit, or adjust comments in GitHub's UI before submitting

**Pending Review Creation:**
- Create a new pending (draft) review on the PR using GitHub MCP tools
- Add inline comments to the pending review for each line-specific finding:
  - Specify file path relative to repository root
  - Specify line number (or line range for multi-line comments)
  - Specify which side of the diff (new code vs old code)
  - Include comment text with suggestion
- Save the pending review for human to edit and submit
- Do not submit the review automatically

**Tone Adjustment Support:**
- If human requests tone changes, delete the pending review and recreate with adjusted tone
- Use GitHub MCP tools to remove the pending review
- Regenerate all comments with requested tone adjustments
- Recreate pending review with updated comments
- Alternative: Human can edit individual comments directly in GitHub's UI

**Comment Quality:**
- Batch related issues into single, cohesive comments
- Provide specific, actionable suggestions with code examples
- Link to review artifacts for detailed reasoning in review body
- Use professional, constructive tone throughout
- Use inclusive language ("we", "let's") rather than accusatory ("you didn't")
- **Distinguish inline vs thread comments** based on whether the issue is location-specific or broader
- For inline comments, specify exact file path and line numbers/ranges
- Document any thread comments in ReviewComments.md for manual addition

**Noise Reduction:**
- DO NOT create separate inline comments for every minor issue on adjacent lines; batch them
- Group related items by file or concept
- Collapse minor items into fewer comprehensive comments
- NEVER comment on code the PR didn't touch
- Skip style feedback unless it impacts readability significantly
- Use thread comments for patterns that appear multiple times instead of commenting each instance inline

3. Check for missing tests on complex logic
4. Review integration points carefully
5. Note if "too large to review thoroughly"

**Stage R3 (15-25 minutes):**
1. Generate comprehensive feedback with agent
2. Agent creates pending review with all comments
3. **Open PR in GitHub** to review all pending comments
4. **Edit or delete** comments to fit PR scope and relationship
5. May suggest splitting PR in review body
6. Adjust tone for critical Must items if needed
7. **Submit review** when ready

**Total time:** 65-110 minutes, with possible recommendation to split PR

## Relationship to Implementation Workflow

### Similarities

- **Staged with artifacts:** Each stage produces durable markdown documents
- **Rewindable:** Can restart earlier stages if understanding changes
- **Human-in-loop:** Critical decisions require human judgment
- **Evidence-based:** All findings traced to specific code references
- **Traceable:** Clear lineage from changes → understanding → evaluation → feedback

### Differences

- **Direction:** Reverse engineering (implementation → spec) vs forward design (spec → implementation)
- **Output:** Analysis and feedback vs code changes
- **Cycle time:** Hours vs days/weeks
- **Iteration:** Typically single-pass per stage vs multiple implementation phases

### Integration Points

- **Post-review:** Can create implementation issues/PRs from Must/Should items using PAW implementation workflow
- **Artifacts:** Review artifacts can inform future implementation planning
- **Patterns:** Gap analysis categories can improve future Spec and Implementation Plan quality
