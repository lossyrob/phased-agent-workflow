We are at the final PR stage of the PAW process for the work at .paw/work/paw-review/WorkflowContext.md. However there was an oversight that we need to correct. The implementation plan doesn't include a new agent for code research. The existing .github/chatmodes/PAW-02A Code Researcher.chatmode.md is a code researcher for implementation, but the review code researcher has different responsibilities. 

It looks like the paw-review-specification.md was updated to include this `PAW Review Baseline Researcher`, but the work Spec.md and ImplementationPlan.md were not updated to include this new agent.

The naming should be consistent, and requies a rename of the understanding agent chatmode:
- `PAW-R1A Understanding Agent` (renamed from `PAW-R1 Understanding Agent`)
- `PAW-R1B Baseline Researcher Agent` (new agent)

Please update the implementation plan, and if necessary the Spec.md, to include this new agent and responsibilities. The code researcher specifically finds the baseline of the code before changes, checks out that code, and answers the research questions.
