Create or update documentation for the work done in .paw/work/paw-review/WorkflowContext.md. Focus on making the review process clear in the README. Also, ensure that paw-review-specification.md reflects the current workflow and roles accurately; some of the ideas in that specification were refined during implementation, and the spec should be updated to match the final design.
