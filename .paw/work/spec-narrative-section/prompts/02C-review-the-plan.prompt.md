Review the implementation plan at .paw/work/spec-narrative-section/ImplementationPlan.md in the context of .paw/work/spec-narrative-section/context/spec-research.md

What remains unimplemented from its suggestions? What differences in approach are taken? Is there recommendations or components of hte research taht could improve the Spec Agent but are not included in the plan, even if they fall outside the scope of the narrative sections?
